# Design And Analysis Of Algorithm : Student’s Complete Guide

Hey everyone! 👋

This repo has a detailed PDF study guide for some of the most important algorithms and classic problems from Anany Levitin’s famous textbook — *Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (3rd Edition)*.

If you’re a CS student like me, this is your one-stop resource for:

- Clear problem statements
- Step-by-step algorithm explanations
- Important formulas and theory
- Real-world examples to understand why these matter
- And (bonus!) all the C code implementations for practice

## What’s Inside?

We cover 16 key algorithms and problems like:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Sorting algorithms (Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- N-Queens
- Knapsack problems (0/1 and Fractional)
- Graph algorithms like Kruskal’s and Dijkstra’s
- Convex Hull (Graham Scan)
- Miller–Rabin primality test
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Dijkstra, Kruskal, and more

## Why You Should Use This

- Perfect for exam prep, interviews, or just to get a strong grip on algorithms.
- Written in a way that’s easy to understand and follow.
- Bridges theory with practical coding skills.
- Helps you get better at problem-solving.

## Join the Team! 🙌

This is a collaborative project. I want all my friends and fellow students to join and help make this guide even better! You can contribute by:

- Fixing typos or mistakes
- Making explanations clearer
- Adding new algorithms or problems
- Sharing tips, tricks, or example questions
- Improving formatting or adding diagrams
- Uploading additional C programs or solutions

Just fork the repo, make your changes, and send a pull request. No matter how small your contribution, it helps everyone learn better!

## How to Use

- Download the PDF and study anywhere, anytime.
- Check out the `Basic Level`, `Moderate Level`, and `High Level` folders for C programs.
- Use it for practice, assignments, or group study sessions.
